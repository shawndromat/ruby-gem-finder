Notes:
* I chose to throw in React because I'm pretty familiar with it, including the dependencies and how to configure webpack for it. And while it might be a bit heavy for a little project like this, frameworks like React have built into them nice separation between template and code. And since React encourages de-composing your page into many smaller components, I find it helps me organize my frontend into nice small pieces with encapsulated responsibilities and encourages good code structure and dependency inversion.
* Testing with `localStorage` was pretty strange. I considered passing it in as a dependency and then implementing or pulling in an existing fake during testing. But even then, I felt I needed to inspect the internal state of it to feel confident the app was truly storing things correctly. Not only did that go against my testing instincts, but JSON stringifying/parsing things was cumbersome. I considered writing my own wrapper with a nice API but then I found one on npm instead!
* In the interest of time, I did not throw a feature/behavioral test around this as I didn't want to fall down a rabbit hole of finding out the best js based feature testing tool. There are a couple places of integration that actually are not tested right now, namely the connection of the "addToFavorites" method to the SearchResult component and the "removeFromFavorites" method to the Favorite component. While it's possible to test that through the App's unit tests, I think that's putting the wrong kind of responsibility in that test.
